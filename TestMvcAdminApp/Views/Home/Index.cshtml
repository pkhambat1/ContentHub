<h2>Welcome to ContentHub</h2>

            ContentHub is a project to demonstrate <i>authentication</i> and <i>authorization</i> of users in a web app. The authorization is designed in a hierarchy that goes from users down to roles, down to permissions and finally down to rights.
            Each right corresponds to one page of the website.
        <p>
        <p>
            The website not only locks out users that are not logged in but it also checks for the user's assigned roles to determine whether they are allowed to view a particular page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can be assigned <i>roles</i> such as "Executive", "Manager", "Content Creator", etc. which will determine the <i>permissions</i> they have.
            For instance, executives can read, add and modify all other users' roles, the permissions of each role and the <i>rights</i> of each permission. Managers can only view the same.
            The website successfully demonstrates how in real time these authorizations can be modified and immediately reflect in a user either gaining or losing access to a respective page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ContentHub structure of authorizations can be used in internal-use admin websites to establish nuance in the amount of access a user (employee) is granted.
